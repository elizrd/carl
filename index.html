      <h4>Biography</h4>
      
      <div>
        <p>My undergraduate degree was in physics at the University of Nottingham, from which I graduated in 2003. During this time, I spent a year on exchange at the University of Toronto.<br />
        <br />
        For my PhD I stayed in Nottingham, although I switched disciplines and studied experimental psychology. Specifically, I worked on the statistical processing of visuomotor distributions and brain imaging of the learning of predictable and random force sequences. Along the way, I was involved in the development of a novel device for providing forces to the human finger inside the MRI scanner. I was supervised by Professor Stephen Jackson in the School of Psychology and Professor Peter Morris in the Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance Centre.<br />
        <br />
        In 2006 I started postdoctoral work with Professor Chris Miall at the University of Birmingham. I worked mainly on behavioural studies using the vBOT robotic manipulandum to investigate state-dependent reaching movements. I successfully defended my PhD in February 2008 and graduated in July 2008.<br />
        <br />
        In October 2009 I moved to Kingston, Ontario, Canada to work with Professor Stephen Scott at Queen&#39;s University. My work here consists of further behavioural and clinical studies, including electromyography recordings, alongside building neuronal network models of human arm control. I was awarded a two-year NeuroDevNet postdoctoral fellowship to extend my clinical work to populations of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.<br />
        <br />
        Starting in November 2012, I took a change in career direction and left full-time research. I spent several months travelling the world, making money by freelancing, performing pre-submission editing of academic papers of scientists without English as their first language.<br />
        <br />
        I moved to Toronto in September 2013, and I am currently freelancing in a variety of fields: editing, content writing, coding, tutoring, and music.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h4>Research</h4>
      
      <div>
        <p>
          During my nine years as a PhD student and postdoctoral fellow, I engaged in 
          a wide variety of research into human motor control.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Behavioural</h5>
        <p>Much of my motor control research was on behavioural experiments in 
          humans. I was primarily interested in reaching movements; it is a 
          complex and difficult task to activate all the muscles in the human arm 
          in just the right order to attain a goal, and yet it is something that 
          we do so naturally that we do not even think about it. Goal-directed 
          reaches are a huge part of human interactions with the world, and how 
          we learn to both control our actions and predict their sensory 
          consequences is an interesting problem.
          <br/><br/>
          In this arena, I explored how we learn perturbations on one arm that 
          depend on the state of the other arm (Jackson & Miall, 2008) as well as 
          investigating a novel sensory illusion that arises following a 
          voluntary arm movement (Jackson & Miall, 2010). I also studied the 
          impact of proprioception on visual attention (Jackson, Miall and 
          Balslev, 2010) and was involved with the development of a novel device 
          to provide force feedback during fMRI experiments (Jackson et al., 
          2008).</p>
        
        <h5>Computational</h5>
        <p>I also explored some computational models of motor control (e.g., 
          Haith et al., 2008). The primary issues involved in creating a 
          computational model centre around explanatory power and physiological 
          realism. Just as it would be pointless to laboriously build a 
          physiologically realistic model that did not work, so too nobody wants 
          a model that can explain everything but that cannot possibly be 
          implemented in the brain.
          <br/><br/>
          Neuronal network models allow the amount of realism and explanatory 
          power to be carefully tuned depending on the nature of the problem. The 
          great advantages of using networks are that they are intrinsically good 
          at generalising what they have learned in one configuration to other 
          configurations. Itâ€™s been exciting to see the progress of machine 
          learning using deep neural networks over the last few years.</p>
  
        <h5>Clinical</h5>
        <p>The use of robotic technology in rehabilitation following stroke is 
          well-established. However, the use of robotic technology for the 
          assessment of impairments following stroke is still in its infancy. In t
          his domain, I developed an intuitive bimanual robotic task with the aim 
          of finding parameters that can be used to give an objective assessment 
          of impairments in coordination (Lowrey et al., 2014). This task is now 
          being used to identify similar impairments in children with fetal 
          alcohol spectrum disorder (Williams et al., 2014).</p>

      <p>I have a lot
        of experience with many programming languages, but I&#8217;m probably
        best at MATLAB, Python, Java, and C++, roughly in that order. I&#8217;ve
        been doing a few bespoke freelance projects, but I&#8217;m always
        interested in more.</p>
      
      <h5>MATLAB Data Analysis</h5>
      <p>My bread and butter,
        for a good decade when I was working in academia. I can write,
        refactor, optimise, and troubleshoot MATLAB code. Mostly the
        applications for this work are in the academic or scientific industry
        fields, so drop me a line if you&#8217;re interested in my help.
      </p>
      
      <h5>R to Python</h5>
      <p>Recently I undertook
        a project in which I converted a whole bunch of code from R to
        Python, which was challenging and fun. I&#8217;ve been learning more
        about dataframes and the new tools of data science recently, and I&#8217;m
        comfortable with slicing, dicing, and analysis in both languages.</p>

        <h5>Solo piano</h5>
        <img class="full-width" src="corgan.jpg" />
        <p>I am an accomplished pianist and alongside playing with Julia I also perform elsewhere. For example, I was a special skills extra and played on the third season of the cult TV show <i>Hannibal,</i> as well as on some less conventional projects &ndash; for example, I performed on an organ with the keys made entirely made of cucumbers for a Hendricks Gin marketing campaign.</p>

      <h4>Theatre</h4>
      <p>Theatre is also
        something I have been passionate about for many years. I have acted
        and directed in several productions recently.</p>

        <h5>Proof</h5>
        <img class="full-width" src="site-content_html_a56c71110036366b.jpg" />
        <p>In March 2017, Theatre UnBlocked presented an independent production of <i>Proof,</i> a full-length play by David Auburn. The play won a Pulitzer prize and a Tony award, and centres around a young woman who is forced to look after her brilliant mathematician father after he becomes mentally ill. The production, which I directed, received rave <a href="https://www.mooneyontheatre.com/2017/03/11/review-proof-theatre-unblocked/"> reviews</a>.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://theatreinspirato.ca/">InspiraTO Festival</a> is a ten-minute play festival now in its twelfth year. In 2016 I attended their directing academy, and directed a play (<i>Paul and Petandra</i>) that won the People&#39;s Choice Award for its category. I also acted in the play <i>Backstory.</i> In June 2017, I directed the play <i>Immortals</i> for the festival, as well as acting in <i>Santa Doesn&#39;t Live Here Any More</i>â€‹.</p>

        <p>I music directed and played the piano for <a href="https://www.theatrehn.com/">Theatre HN</a>&#39;s production of <i>The Last Five Years</i> in September 2017. Learning the score, written by Jason Robert Brown, was a huge personal challenge for me, and I spent three months focusing on little else.
